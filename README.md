# Fractals
 A Fractal Generator that lets you explore the Julia and Mandelbrot sets.

# Description
Generates the Mandelbrot Fractal and various other fractals from the Julia set.

Both Mandelbrot Set and Julia Set are generated from the funtion  
> f(z) = z <sup>2</sup> + c  
> where z and c are complex numbers.

The difference being, the position of pixels relative to a graph are substitued in c (z initially set to 0) in Mandelbrot whereas the same value is substitued in z while keeping c a constant in the Julia Set.

Substituting different values of c gives different fractal patterns.

The app has 10 different fractals *(Mandelbrot Fractal + 9 Fractals from the Julia Set)* you can interact with.
